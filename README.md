Mpsqd is a python package that uses matrix product states (MPS) to solve both the time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) and the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM).

### Installation
`pip install mpsqd`

### Usage
Two modes for using the code are provided.

- The first one is provided for several applications in the `/examples` folder, where the user provides necessary python files for initial conditions, construction of the MPO, while using the `mpsqd` package as a library to to theMPS oprtations and time-dependent propagation.
- The second approach uses the pre-built models, where the models are presented in the `/models` folder, examples for this type of usage in provided in the `/ipynb` folder.

### Documentation
Primitive documentation can be found in the included `.ipynb` files.
